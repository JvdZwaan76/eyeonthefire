    <h1>Terms of Service for Eye on the Fire</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 17, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to Eye on the Fire ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Service"), including the USA Fire Map, which provides real-time wildfire tracking using data from NASA FIRMS. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, available at <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Google Authentication</h2>
    <p>The Service uses Google Sign-In and OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and access certain Google user data, such as your Google Account email and basic profile information. By signing in with Google, you authorize us to access and use this data in accordance with Google's API Services User Data Policy and our Privacy Policy. We accurately represent our identity as Eye on the Fire, a wildfire tracking service, in all permission requests. You may revoke access at any time through your Google Account settings.</p>

    <h2>3. User Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We collect and process user data as described in our Privacy Policy. When using Google Sign-In, we only request access to the data necessary for the Service's functionality, such as your email address to identify you and manage your account. We do not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transfer, sell, or use your data for unauthorized purposes, such as serving ads, retargeting, or determining creditworthiness.</li>
      <li>Use your data to develop a similar or competing product or service.</li>
      <li>Mislead Google or users about our app's operating environment or identity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your data against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, in compliance with Google's policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content on the Service, including text, graphics, logos, and software, is the property of Eye on the Fire or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of our content without prior written permission.</p>
    <p>By using Google Sign-In, we may display Google Brand Features (e.g., logos) to indicate that authentication is provided by Google, in accordance with Google's branding guidelines. You may not remove, obscure, or alter any Google branding, logos, or legal notices displayed on the Service.</p>

      <li>Misrepresent your identity or the purpose of your use of the Service.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or derive the source code of the Service or any Google API used by the Service, including the Google Accounts Authentication API.</li>
      <li>Use the Service to distribute harmful code (e.g., viruses, worms) or engage in activities that violate Google's Software Principles.</li>
      <li>Access or use Google user data in ways not explicitly authorized by these Terms or Google's policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms, with or without notice.</p>

    <h2>6. Service Availability and Limitations</h2>
    <p>The Service relies on third-party data, including NASA's FIRMS API, to provide wildfire tracking. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or availability of this data. The Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, express or implied.</p>
    <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time, with or without notice. We are not liable for any damages resulting from such changes or interruptions.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service if you violate these Terms, or if required by Google or other third-party providers (e.g., due to API policy violations). Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
