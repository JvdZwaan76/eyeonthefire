        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 16, 2025</p>
        <p>EyeOnTheFire ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use our website and services, including our interactive wildfire map application ("the App"). The App uses Google Sign-In and Google APIs to provide authentication and location-based services. This policy complies with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a> and applicable privacy laws.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information when you use the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Account Information</strong>: When you sign in with Google, we collect your email address and basic profile information (e.g., name) with your consent via Google Sign-In. This data is used to authenticate you and personalize your experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: If you use the "Locate Me" feature or enter a zip code, we collect your approximate location (latitude and longitude) to display relevant wildfire data. Location data is obtained via your browser’s geolocation API or through Google APIs for zip code searches.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App, such as pages visited, features used, and session duration, to improve our services.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We collect information about your device, including browser type, operating system, and IP address, to ensure compatibility and enhance security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Your Google Account information is used to verify your identity and provide secure access to the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Delivery</strong>: Location data is used to display wildfire information relevant to your area and to center the map based on your searches or geolocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Improvement</strong>: Usage and device data help us analyze performance, fix bugs, and enhance the App’s functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: We use device information to detect and prevent unauthorized access or fraudulent activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We limit our use of Google user data to the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy, as required by Google’s API Services User Data Policy.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

            <li><strong>Google APIs</strong>: When you use Google Sign-In or zip code search, your data is processed by Google in accordance with their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not control Google’s data handling practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share Google user data with third parties for advertising, data brokering, or any purposes beyond what is disclosed in this policy.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>

            <li>Regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.</li>
